<font size="5">Well that was that! I know you probably solved these in 12 minutes but what can I say.<br> I really hope you enjoyed this, I know it is a bit silly but being far apart it's the most creative present I could think of. :)<br>

You can now enjoy the prize, which is I have been trying to learn some songs on guitar to dedicate to you.<br> You will even find an ABBA song, because obviously I should give you one of those,<br> but mainly there's an italian song called "A te" (to you), it is a very romantic song which I felt actually describes a lot of ways in which I am so crazy in love with you.<br> I dedicate it to you, feel free to find English lyrics for it if you want. I know I am bad at playing and singing, I have been practicing for a week in the time I could find.<br> I can not wait to see you again, you are everything to me and this year has been absolutely wonderful because of you.<br>

You have shown me so many new things and so many new ways to live my life<br>and now all I want is to live my life with you.<br>

p.s. in case you were reaaally fast at solving them, the videos may not be uploaded yet! I am trying to make them as fast as I can for you. :D <br></font>

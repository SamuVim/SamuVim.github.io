<br><br><br>It's difficult to make a thoughtful anniversary present being so far away. I will try my best to entertain you a bit through the means of the world wide web, where even an idiot like myself can publish a website.<br>
You have many times solved riddles together with me, you even made some for me and others to solve, so I thought now it is my turn to try. Maybe you will be bored and this may be too easy for you, but I do hope you enjoy. I am sure I will enjoy making this at least.(I am writing this page first, it's the 9th of September) There might even be something for you at the end.<br>
I'm sure you know the tricks of how to solve online riddles by now, so no need to make any sort of explanation about this. There is a hints page, I'm sure that also won't be too hard to find. And of course you can always ask me. The first level is on level1.html.<br>
Good luck.<br>Love, Samuele.<br>

I hope you are enjoying this. Being with you has made the past year wonderful in so many ways. You have shown me so many different new things and I am just so grateful that I can be with you. We don't take many pictures together, but here are some memories from our year together. I am so happy that we have traveled to so many places and I know that we will keep doing so forever. I love you so much. (btw you are so pretty^^)<br>

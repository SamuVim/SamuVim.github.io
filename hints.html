Here are some hints. To reveal them, just highlight the text - that way there are no spoilers for later levels.<br>

<font color="green">Level 1: Name what you do between the two animals.<br>

Level 2: What do the pictures mean? Then, look at the items on the list.<br>

Level 3: What do they have at the back of the shirt? Write down the one that corresponds to each player. Looking at the names of the images together with Wikipedia helps.<br>

Level 4: Use some program to match the two pictures, and/or solve the anagram.<br>

Level 5: What is the image called? Refer to that.<br>

Level 6: Count the asterisks. What does it mean?</font><br>
